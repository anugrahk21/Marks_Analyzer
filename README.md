# GPA Analyzer Tool (C++)

A comprehensive C++ console application for calculating Term GPA (TGPA) and Cumulative GPA (CGPA) for students.

## Features

### ðŸ“š Subject Management
- Input multiple subjects with their details
- Support for subject name, grade, and credit hours
- Validation for all inputs

### ðŸŽ¯ Grade System
- **O** = 10 (Outstanding)
- **A+** = 9 (Excellent)
- **A** = 8 (Very Good)
- **B+** = 7 (Good)
- **B** = 6 (Above Average)
- **C** = 5 (Average)
- **D** = 4 (Below Average)
- **E/F/G/I** = 0 (Fail/Incomplete)

### ðŸ“Š GPA Calculations
- **TGPA (Term GPA)**: `Î£(grade_point Ã— credit) / Î£(credits)` for each term
- **CGPA (Cumulative GPA)**: Progressive calculation after each term entry
- **Progressive Display**: Shows current CGPA after each term is entered
- Results rounded to 2 decimal places
- Formula: `(TGPA1Ã—Credits1 + TGPA2Ã—Credits2 + ... + TGPAnÃ—Creditsn) / (Total Credits)`

### ðŸ’¡ Additional Features
- Beautiful ASCII table formatting
- **Multi-term support**: Enter all terms at once
- **Smart CGPA display**: Shows CGPA only when more than 1 term
- **Clear final message**: "YOUR OVERALL CGPA FROM THE GIVEN N TERMS: X.XX"
- **Term-wise analysis**: Individual TGPA calculation for each term
- **Additional term option**: Add more terms after completing initial N terms
- **Comprehensive statistics**: Highest/lowest TGPA, total credits
- **Performance feedback**: Real-time feedback after each term
- **Final summary**: Complete term-wise breakdown and analysis
- Option to restart or exit after calculations
- Input validation and error handling

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell
- C++11 or later standard

## Installation & Usage

### Method 1: Using the Batch File (Recommended for Windows)
1. Double-click `run.bat`
2. The program will automatically compile and run

### Method 2: Manual Compilation
```cmd
# Compile the program
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o gpa_analyzer.exe gpa_analyzer.cpp

# Run the program
gpa_analyzer.exe
```

### Method 3: Using Makefile (if you have make installed)
```cmd
# Compile
make

# Run
make run

# Clean build files
make clean
```

## How to Use

1. **Start the Program**: Run the compiled executable
2. **Enter Number of Terms**: Input the total number of terms/semesters
3. **For Each Term**:
   - Enter the number of subjects for that term
   - For each subject, enter:
     - Subject name
     - Grade (O, A+, A, B+, B, C, D, E, F, G, I)
     - Credit hours
   - View TGPA for the current term
   - View CGPA (only shown if more than 1 term)
   - See performance feedback
4. **Final Summary**: View comprehensive results including:
   - Term-wise summary table
   - "YOUR OVERALL CGPA FROM THE GIVEN N TERMS: X.XX"
   - Statistics (highest/lowest TGPA, total credits)
   - Overall performance analysis
5. **Add More Terms**: Option to add additional terms after completing initial N terms
6. **Continue or Exit**: Choose to calculate for another set or exit
