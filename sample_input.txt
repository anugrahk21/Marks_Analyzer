## Expected Program Flow (Updated)
1. Ask for number of terms
2. For each term:
   - Ask for number of subjects
   - Input subject details
   - Calculate and display TGPA for the term
   - Display current CGPA (only if more than 1 term)
   - Show performance feedback
3. Display final summary with:
   - Term-wise summary table
   - "YOUR OVERALL CGPA FROM THE GIVEN N TERMS: X.XX"
   - Statistics (highest/lowest TGPA, total credits)
   - Overall performance feedback
4. Ask "Do you want to add one more term? (y/n)"
5. If yes, repeat for additional terms with updated final summary
6. Ask if user wants to calculate for another set of terms

## Display Logic
- **Single Term (N=1)**: Shows only TGPA, no CGPA mention
- **Multiple Terms (N>1)**: Shows both TGPA and CGPA after each term
- **Final Message**: "YOUR OVERALL CGPA FROM THE GIVEN N TERMS: X.XX"
- **Additional Terms**: Can be added after initial N terms are completed
